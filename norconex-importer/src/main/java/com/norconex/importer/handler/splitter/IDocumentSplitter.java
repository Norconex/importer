/**
 * Responsible for splitting a single document into several ones.  The 
 * {@link Doc} instances returned by implementations will be
 * added as children of a parent {@link ImportDocument}.  Each children
 * will then be passed to this interface again for further splitting if
 * necessary.  Each document returned will also go through the same
 * pre-handler/parse/post-handler cycle as defined in the importer 
 * configuration.
 * <br><br>
 * To blank values form a parent, you do not write to the output stream
 * and blank metadata values as desired.  The parent document will still get
 * processed as usual.  To prevent the parent from being processed
 * further, make sure to filter it out using an {@link IDocumentFilter}
 * implementation.
 * <br><br>
 * If using the default importer parser, keep it mind you can configure it
 * to split most files with embedded content in them (zip, 
 * word processor document with embedded documents, etc).  A typical usage for 
 * this interface is 
 * to break a records-type document into a single document per record. For
 * example, to break some entities from XML data files into separate documents.
