The first chapter of Alice In Wonderland is available in three different 
format for you to test.

To run the test, go to the root directory where you uncompressed the 
distribution zip and run the following.

Windows:

importer.bat -i "examples/books/alice-in-wonderland-book-chapter-1.pdf" -c "examples/config/sample-config.xml" -o "examples/books/example-output.txt"

Unix/Linux:

importer.sh -i "examples/books/alice-in-wonderland-book-chapter-1.pdf" -c "examples/config/sample-config.xml" -o "examples/books/example-output.txt"

Change the extension to ".docx" or ".zip" for a different test.

Look into the example/books folder for new files being created containing
the exported data.
