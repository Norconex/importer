 * Indicates that a parser can be initialized with generic parser configuration
 * settings and it will try to apply any such settings the best it can
 * when possible to do so.  Those settings are typically general settings
 * that applies to more than one parser and can thus be configured "globally"
 * for all applicable parsers.
 * It should be left to {@link IDocumentParserFactory} implementations
 * to initialize parsers as they see fit.
 * The default {@link GenericDocumentParserFactory} will always invoke the
 * {@link #initialize(ParseHints)} method at least once per configured parsers.
